Today Php imagick was throwing an exception:-
not authorized `/tmp/magick-20610404oG96iX2V6' @ error/constitute.c/ReadImage
I had installed the imagick php extension by:-

sudo apt-get install php-imagick

Solved by:-

1.go to /etc/ImageMagick-6 or /etc/ImageMagick
2. In the policy.xml:-
   1.Comment this line:- <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="MVG" />
   2. Giving the read & write permission to pdf:- 
           Change
             <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PDF" />'
           To
             <policy domain="coder" rights="read|write" pattern="PDF" />
3. Then,restart apache2
